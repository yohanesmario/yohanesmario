# Greetings, I'm Mario :wave:

I'm a software engineer who loves turning challenges into real solutions. I’m especially passionate about distributed systems and software architecture, where I get to build reliable, scalable systems that make an impact.

To me, coding is more than just work—it’s a way to create, solve problems, and make a difference.

As technology keeps evolving, I’m excited to keep learning, building, and exploring what’s possible. Let’s connect and see how we can create something great together.
